# Pizza Sales Analysis – 2015

## Objective

The goal is to take a close look at how a pizza business performed over the course of a full year, from **January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2015**.  

I focused on understanding overall sales, customer behavior, and product trends by analyzing key metrics such as revenue, order volume, product preferences, and how sales varied across days, months, categories, and pizza sizes. The insights from this analysis are intended to support data-informed decisions in areas like **inventory planning, marketing strategy, staffing, and menu development**.

## Data Overview

For this project, I worked with a transaction-level dataset that covered all pizza sales throughout 2015. The dataset contains **48,620 records**, with each row representing an individual pizza sold.

You can view the dataset here:  
[**Pizza Sales Dataset (Google Sheets)**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mF1G56ZrwQlksmS5meWgC1yXRgeqGV2T/edit?gid=679792667#gid=679792667)

### The dataset includes the following fields:
- `pizza_id` and `order_id`: Unique identifiers for each pizza and the order it belonged to  
- `pizza_name_id`: A standardized product code for grouping pizzas  
- `order_date`: Timestamps for when each pizza was ordered  
- `unit_price` and `total_price`: Pricing information for each item  
- `pizza_size` and `pizza_category`: Details for product segmentation  
- `pizza_ingredients` and `pizza_name`: Product descriptions and display names

Before analysis, I cleaned and reviewed the data to ensure consistency, accuracy, and readiness for exploration.

## Key Findings

### 1. Customer Preferences
Customers clearly favored:
- **Classic pizzas**, which were the best-selling category with over **15,000 units sold**.
- **Large pizzas**, which accounted for nearly **46%** of all sales, suggesting group orders or a preference for better value.

### 2. Ordering Patterns
- **Friday** had the highest number of orders (around **3,500**), likely due to weekend dining habits.  
- **Sunday** had the fewest orders, indicating an opportunity to increase activity on that day.

### 3. Seasonal Trends
- **July** was the strongest month with **1,935 orders**, while **September** had the lowest volume at **661**.  
This trend points to a seasonal pattern, with summer being the busiest time.

## Recommendations and Action Points

### 1. Increase Sales in Low-Performing Months

**What I observed:**  
September and October had noticeably lower order volumes.

**My recommendation:**  
- Launch promotions or themed offers during slow months.  
- Align campaigns with local events or seasonal activities to draw more customers.

**Action:**  
I suggest creating a monthly promotion calendar and tracking the results of each campaign to measure effectiveness.

### 2. Encourage Upselling of Popular Products

**What I observed:**  
Classic pizzas and Large sizes were top choices for most customers.

**My recommendation:**  
- Develop combo deals using these bestsellers, such as a Large Classic Pizza with a drink.  
- Add upsell suggestions in the ordering process to encourage upgrades or add-ons.

**Action:**  
I recommend updating the menu layout to feature these items and testing upsell messaging both online and in-store to improve average order value.

### 3. Maximize Revenue on Busy and Slow Days

**What I observed:**  
Friday was the busiest day, and Sunday the slowest.

**My recommendation:**  
- Introduce premium bundles or new limited-time offers on Fridays to capitalize on high traffic.  
- Use discounts or family-oriented deals on Sundays to boost activity.

**Action:**  
I would adjust staffing levels according to these trends and run weekly ads (for example, every Thursday and Sunday) to drive engagement at the right time.

This analysis gave me a clear view of what was working well and where there was room for improvement. It also provided practical insights that can help the business make smarter decisions moving forward—whether that's increasing revenue, managing operations more efficiently, or better serving its customers.
