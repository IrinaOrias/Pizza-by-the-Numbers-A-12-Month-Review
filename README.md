## Objective

The main goal of this project was to evaluate the performance of a pizza business throughout 2015. I used Power BI to analyze key business metrics, such as revenue, total orders, pizza preferences by size and category, and variations in customer behavior by day and month.

The insights generated from this project are designed to support data-driven decisions in areas such as **menu strategy**, **promotional planning**, **seasonal adjustments**, and **operational efficiency**.
