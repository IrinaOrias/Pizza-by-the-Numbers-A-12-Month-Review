## **Pizza Sales Analysis â€” SQL & Power BI Project**

### **Overview**

This project explores a pizza restaurant's sales dataset using **SQL** for data analysis and **Power BI** for visualization. My goal was to practice writing practical queries, uncovering business insights, and designing clear, insightful dashboards that reflect real-world decision-making needs.

### **Why I Chose This Project**

I chose this project because it's both fun and representative of real business problems. Working with sales data allowed me to ask relevant questions like:

* What are the busiest times for pizza sales?
* Which pizza types are most popular?
* What categories generate the most revenue?
* Are there seasonal or weekly trends in customer orders?

This project helped me strengthen my ability to work with raw data, build analytical logic, and communicate findings visuallyâ€”all crucial skills for a data-driven role.

### **Skills Used**

* **SQL (Structured Query Language)**
  Used for data extraction, aggregation, and cleaning. I wrote multiple queries to calculate metrics like average order size, revenue per category, peak days/months, and sales distribution.

* **Power BI**
  Used to design interactive dashboards that communicate trends clearly and effectively.

* **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
  Ensured consistent column types, identified useful dimensions (like date parts), and prepared clean, query-ready data.

* **Data Analysis**
  Interpreted results, explored patterns, and connected data points to real-world business implications.

### **Project Highlights**

Some of the key insights and queries explored in this project include:

* **Average Pizzas Per Order**
  Calculated using total quantity divided by distinct orders.

* **Revenue by Pizza Type and Size**
  Helped identify which products are top earners.

* **Orders by Day of the Week & Month**
  Used to uncover weekly and monthly patterns.

* **% of Sales by Pizza Category**
  Explored how much each pizza category contributes to total revenue.

* **Top 5 and Bottom 5 Bestselling Pizzas**
  Helpful for decision-making on promotions or menu adjustments.

Each of these analyses is visualized in **Power BI** with clearly labeled charts and dynamic filters for further exploration.
